# SQL-Injection-in-CyberSecurity
This project demonstrates a SQL Injection attack and the steps taken to prevent it, highlighting secure coding practices for web applications. The application is initially vulnerable to SQL injection, and the demonstration walks through how to exploit the vulnerability. Afterward, we apply necessary security measures to mitigate the risk and ensure the application is protected.

Steps Covered:
Creating a Vulnerable Web Application:

A basic web application is developed that interacts with a database.
The application is intentionally designed to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
Simulating SQL Injection Attack:

A demonstration of an SQL injection attack on the application, showing how attackers can manipulate SQL queries to retrieve, modify, or delete data from the database.
Securing the Application:

Implementing countermeasures such as prepared statements and parameterized queries.
Using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools and applying input validation to thwart SQL injection attacks.
Testing the Application:

The application is tested to ensure that after implementing security measures, the vulnerability is successfully mitigated, and the application is immune to SQL injections.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP (or Node.js, Python, or any other suitable backend language)
Database: MySQL or SQLite
Security Measures: Prepared Statements, Parameterized Queries, Input Validation
